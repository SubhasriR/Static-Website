					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<a href="#slide-4" class="cn-back">Back</a>
					<div class="cn-content">
						<p><b>Introduction</b><br><br>Malayalam literature  comprises those literary texts written in Malayalam, a South-Dravidian language spoken in the Indian state of Kerala.<br><br>
The earliest known extant literary work in Malayalam is Ramacharitam, an epic poem written by Cheeraman in the late 13th or early 13th century. In the subsequent centuries, besides a popular pattu ("song") literature, the manipravalam poetry also flourished. Manipravalam (translates "ruby coral") style mainly consisted of poetry in an admixture of Malayalam and Sanskrit. Then came works such as champus and sandeshakavyas in which prose and poetry were interspersed. .<br><br>
 Later, poets like Cherusseri introduced poems on devotional themes. There were also other important works, similar to manipravalam, in Arabi Malayalam like Muhyadheen Mala. Ezhuthachan, a strong proponent of Bhakti movement, is known as the father of Malayalam. His poems are classified under the genre of kilippattu. .<br><br>

Modern literary movements in Malayalam literature began in the late 19th century with the rise of the famous Modern Triumvirate consisting of Kumaran Asan, Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer and Vallathol Narayana Menon. Kumaran Asan was temperamentally a pessimist—a dispositionreinforced by his metaphysics—yet all his life was active in promoting his downtrodden Hindu-Ezhava community. .<br><br>
 Ullor wrote in the classical tradition, on the basis of which he appealed for universal love, while Vallathol responded to the human significance of social progress. Contemporary Malayalam poetry records the encounter with problems of social, political, and economic life. The tendency of the modern poetry is often regarded as toward political radicalism. .<br><br>

Banana chips are deep-fried and/or dried slices of banana. They can be covered with sugar or honey and have a sweet taste, or they can be fried in oil and spices and have a salty and/or spicy taste. Variants of banana chips may be covered with chocolate instead. <br><br>Usually, the chips are produced from underripe bananas, of which slices are deep-fried in sunflower oil or coconut oil, which are then dried, and to which preservatives are added. These varieties of chips can be very oily, due to the deep-frying process. <br><br>	
Another form of fried banana chips, usually made in Kerala (India) and known locally as 'upperi', is fried in coconut oil. Both ripe and unripe bananas are used for this variant. <br><br>Sometimes they are coated with masala or jaggery to form both spicy and sweet variants. It is an integral part of the traditional Kerala meal called sadya served during weddings and traditional festivals such as Onam Banana Chips. <br><br>Made from unripe bananas and deep fried in coconut oil, thesebanana chips are crispy and tasty. <br><br>These South Indian fried snacks are largely demanded in domestic as well as international markets. <br><br>

It is either boiled or cooked with spices. Tapioca with fish curry (especially Sardine) is a delicacy Kerala is known for. <br><br>Thinly sliced tapioca wafers, similar to potato chips, are popular too. Cassava, often referred to as tapioca in English, is called Kappa Kizhangu or Poola (in northern Kerala) or Maracheeni Kizhangu or Cheeni or Kolli in Malayalam. <br><br>Tapioca is used to make a granular product (Tapioca Pearls) called chowwary in Malayalam.

That's why a novice cook who is unsure of the names and prices of the fare but has to go vegetable shopping can safely ask for an avial kootu (an avial mixture) for, say, forty or fifty rupees and be assured of a variety of vegetables for the week. <br><br>These don't include the leafy ones though.</p>
